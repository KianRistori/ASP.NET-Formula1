# ASP.NET-Formula1

The project involves the development of a web app for managing Formula 1 drivers using the ASP.NET MVC framework and the C# programming language. The application is hosted on a web server and is accessible through a web browser. The application has a user interface that allows users to enter, modify, and view information about Formula 1 drivers, such as their name, nationality, and team. In addition, it is possible to enter and view information about the engines used by drivers. The information is stored in a database and is managed using SQL queries and stored procedures.
